# Use Express and Mongoose to create an application that organizes code snippets that you save for later use.


Snippets have:

a title
a body (the code)
optional notes
a language
tags -- that is, user-defined words or phrases that classify the code, like "authentication", "front-end", "middleware", or "database".

The application must:

-Have a comprehensive set of tests for all controllers and models
-Have registration and login
-Allow you to create a snippet
-Allow you to see a list of all your snippets
-Allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific language
-Allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific tag
-Allow you to look at an individual snippet
-Have an API to allow for creating and viewing of snippets as listed above
